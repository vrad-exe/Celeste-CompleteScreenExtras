# Complete Screen Extras

Celeste mod that reimplements the animation on the "chapter complete" text seen in pre-release versions of the game. It also allows enabling the rainbow text which normally is only used for the wavedash powerpoint.

The code for this is probably a bit messy because it's my first time doing a code mod (or really touching C# at all lmao) - feel free to let me know how I could have done things better or make a pull request if there's something horribly wrong.
