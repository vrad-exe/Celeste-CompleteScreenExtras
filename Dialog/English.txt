# NOTES:
# The # Symbol at the start of a line counts as a Comment. To include in dialog, use a \#
# The . Symbol will cause a pause unless escaped with \. (ex: Mr. Oshiro has a pause, Mr\. Oshiro does not)
# Newlines automatically create a Page Break, unless there is an {n} command on the previous line
# Commands: Anything inside of curly braces {...} is a command and should not be translated.

# Inline Text Commands:
# {~}wavy text{/~}
# {!}impact text{/!}
# {>> x}changes speed at which characters are displayed{>>}
# {# 000000}this text is black{#} (uses HEX color values)
# {+MENU_BEGIN} inserts the dialog from the MENU_BEGIN value (in English, "CLIMB")
# {n} creates a newline, without a page break
# {0.5} creates a 0.5 second pause
# {big}this text is large{/big}

# Gameplay Control Commands (should never change)
# {trigger x} this triggers an in-game event
# {anchor} controls the visual position of the textbox in-game
